This project was designed to sort through a list of items purchased at the corner store and allow a more simplified view.
I was able to figure out how to have a very small main function here since it is a simple program
I had issues where I wanted to be able to do as the project asked and write this using both python and C++ though I could not get my visual studio to allow this
My challenge was how long and how many attempts I tried to get my visual studio to allow me to use multiple languages together.
I enjoyed learning about Maps and how to use them, I enjoyed how simple that made this feel to me.
I use a lot of space when writing my programs so that when things go together you can clearly tell by the group they are in.
